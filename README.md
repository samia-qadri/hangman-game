ðŸŽ¯ Hangman Game - Python Console Project
Hi ! This is me Samia Qadri - student of software engineering.
Here is my python mini-project.

This is a simple console-based *Hangman Game* built using **Python**.  
You guess letters to uncover a hidden word before you run out of lives.  
Built as part of my Python practice during semester break.
